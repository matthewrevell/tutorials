Exoscale is a Swiss cloud provider focusing on simplicity and security.

## Who we are
We are a startup founded in 2011 in Lausanne, Switzerland. Our goal is to
provide simple, scalable, yet affordable cloud infrastructure services from
safe locations.

## Our service offerings
Exoscale offers 4 types of cloud services.

### Infrastructure as a Service
Exoscale's **Compute** offering lets you start an Instance of your favorite
Operating System in less than 40 seconds. You manage your servers and we take
care of the rest.

The full list of
[available templates](https://www.exoscale.ch/open-cloud/templates/)
 is publicly available and updated frequently.

You can start with an Instance as small as 1CPU, 512MB Ram and 10GB Disk, and
scale, in a matter of seconds, to a huge 8CPU, 32GB Ram and 400GB Disk.
And if you need more, feel free to contact us!

### Storage as a Service
Exoscale's **Storage** allows you to store, distribute and manage
large quantities of files (objects).
You can store almost anything in SOS: assets, backups, email attachments,
videos, pictures and anything else you may imagine.

Exoscale's **Infrastructure Marketplace** lets you choose from several services,
such as Application Hosting for your Python, Ruby, NodeJS applications, and
Add-Ons like MySQL, Backup.

### DNS
When deploying an Instance or an Application, you want it to be accessible,
in a simple and reliable way. Our DNS service allows you to control your
Domain Name, its records, [from our interface](/documentation/dns/recipes),
and also [from the API](/documentation/dns/api-recipes).
